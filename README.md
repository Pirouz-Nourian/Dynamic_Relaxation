This repository has been created as an educational resource for the course [EARTHY: Computational Design for Earth Architecture](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=48987)

The code is mainly inspired by and largely based on the [code smaples generously shared by the Block Research Group in ETH Zurich, Prof. Philippe Block, Dr. Tom van Mele et al.](http://block.arch.ethz.ch/blog/2014/07/dynamic-relaxation/). 

Based on the method explained in the slides available on this repository, after the two references found thanks to our colleague Dirk Rinze Visser:
